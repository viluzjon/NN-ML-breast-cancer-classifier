# Breast Cancer Classification

This project utilizes a machine learning model to classify breast cancer data as malignant or benign using an MLP classifier. The dataset is derived from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which provides various features related to cell nuclei.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
-Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/viluzjon/NN-ML-breast-cancer-classifier.git
cd NN-ML-breast-cancer-classifier

-Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

-Run the cells to train the MLP classifier and evaluate the model.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which can be accessed via sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer. 
The dataset includes 30 numeric features and a target label indicating whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

# Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix visualizations.
